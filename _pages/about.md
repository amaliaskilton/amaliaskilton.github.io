I am a Chancellor's Fellow (= assistant professor) in linguistics at The University of Edinburgh. I've also held research positions at Cornell University, the University of Texas at Austin, and as a guest, at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.

I'm a field linguist and linguistic anthropologist
======
I study language use in interaction across cultures and the lifespan. My research interests include first language acquisition, pragmatics, and language documentation. All of my research is based on my own fieldwork â€“ I have conducted over 26 months of fieldwork in the Amazon Basin with speakers of Indigenous languages, primarily Ticuna (ISO: tca; isolate).
